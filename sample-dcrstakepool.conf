; From the RFP:
; Per the temporary soft cap of 5% of the tickets, pool operators will be
; required to turn off new registrations for their pool once they have >= 5.0%
; of the tickets in their pool.  Once the initial 3 month period is over, the
; pool can re-enable registrations and remove its soft cap.
; This option disables signups and prevents already signed up users from
; submitting an address if they have not done so already.
;closepool=1

; Default message mentions the 5% cap and asks to find a different pool.
; If you want to specify a custom message, do so here.
;closepoolmsg=We're closing for a different reason!
